## Project Description

The project is to build a personal portfolio website using React. The purpose of this project is to showcase your skills, experience, and projects to potential employers and clients.

## Usage Instructions

### Locally hosting

To ensure that all the necessary dependencies are installed, make sure that the package.json files have been properly copied over. Once this is done, open your terminal in the project's main directory and enter the command 'npm i' to install all the required dependencies.

After the dependencies have been installed, you can start the backend and serve the client by entering the command 'npm run start' in the terminal. This will initiate the bundling process of the html, css, and javascript files using webpack, along with a service worker and manifest file.

By following these steps, you can successfully start the project and launch it in your preferred browser.
